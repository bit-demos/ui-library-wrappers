## Customised MUI Select

This component customised the core MUI Select via a special added select feature, which... erm creates an encouraging alert on the page when an item has been selected.

There are of course far more useful real-world customisations that can be made to a select component, but this gives you the general idea of how to produce a custom version
of your favourite MUI components with Bit. 

And as you can see, the amount of code this takes is minimal, while all the tooling and dependency settings are carried out via a central custom Bit env

What this component does do, beyond demonstrate a simple customisation of MUI's Select component, is illustrate the application of app-level theming on component compositions via the component's Env. Here, the compositions of this 
component do not include any ThemeProvider, yet the primary colour, which should be blue, has been changed to purple (primary) in this component's compositions.

This is done by applying a theme component as a wrapper to all compositions in the component's Env, in this case the `react-with-mui` environment.

### Component API

Base API - See the MUI Select API [here](https://mui.com/api/select/#props).

### Component usage
```js
<Select
    labelId="demo-simple-select-label"
    id="demo-simple-select"
    value={age}
    label="Age"
    onChange={handleChange}
    >
    <MenuItem value={10}>Ten</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem value={20}>Twenty</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem value={30}>Thirty</MenuItem>
</Select>
```

### Using props to customize the text

Modify the text to see it change live:
```js live
() => {
    const [age, setAge] = useState('');

  return  (
    <FormControl sx={{ m: 1, minWidth: 80 }}>
      <InputLabel id="demo-simple-select-autowidth-label">Age</InputLabel>
      <Select
        labelId="demo-simple-select-label"
        id="demo-simple-select"
        value={age}
        label="Age"
        onChange={(e) => {setAge(e.target.value)}}
      >
        <MenuItem value={10}>Ten</MenuItem>
        <MenuItem value={20}>Twenty</MenuItem>
        <MenuItem value={30}>Thirty</MenuItem>
      </Select>
    </FormControl>
  )
}
```
