## Customised MUI Button

This component customised the core MUI Button via a special click function, which... erm creates an alert on the page.

What this component does do is illustrate the application of app-level theming on component compositions via the component's Env. Here, the compositions of this 
component do not include any ThemeProvider, yet the primary and secondary colours, which should be blue and green, have been changed to purple (primary) and very light blue (secondary)
in the button compositions.

This is done by applying a theme component as a wrapper to all compositions in the component's Env, in this case the `react-with-mui` environment.

### Component usage
```js
<Button text="hello from Button" />
```

### Using props to customize the text

Modify the text to see it change live:
```js live
<Button text="hello from Button" />
```
